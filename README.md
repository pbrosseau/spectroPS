Machine learning tools for spectral pulse shaping in python

An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to determine the ideal amplitude mask that can transform a given pulse spectrum into a desired pulse 
spectrum using an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter (AOPDF), such as the Dazzler by Fastlite.

The AOPDF is a literal black box which shapes the spectral amplitude and phase of a light pulse as a laser beam is transmitted
through the box. As shown in Fig. 1, the AOPDF accepts a 1D amplitude mask vector, A, and an input pulse spectrum, I, and outputs a shaped pulse spectrum, S.

Generally, one desires the pulse spectrum to have a specific shape, such as a super-Gaussian (Fig. 1, orange line). One would therefore 1) measure the
pulse spectrum without an amplitude mask applied by the AOPDF (Fig. 1, blue line), 2) calculate the mask that would generate the desired pulse spectrum and 3) measure the pulse spectrum with the amplitude mask to confirm that the masked spectrum resembles the desired spectrum.

Unfortunately, predicting the necessary mask is not always straightforward. Ideally, the mask could be generated by dividing the desired
spectrum by the un-masked spectrum. Several factors complicate this task. First, the AOPDF masks the amplitude rather than the intensity, 
so the square root of the measured spectrum must be used. Secondly, there is generally a slight calibration off-set between the AOPDF 
wavelength vector and the spectrometer wavelength vector, requiring that the calculated mask is shifted or re-scaled. Thirdly, both the 
spectrometer and AOPDF can have non-linear responses. These three factors make determination of the ideal mask vector a non-trivial task, 
and the calculated mask vector generally differs from the ideal mask vector by some small amount, which could be enough to significantly 
change the shape of the masked pulse spectrum.

The ANN is used to characterize the AOPDF transfer function, F(I,A), and predict the ideal mask, A, for a given input spectrum, I, and a desired output spectrum.

Fig. 2 shows that, once trained, the ANN can predict the ideal amplitude mask for the input spectrum and goal spectrum in Fig. 1.
The shaped output spectrum with the modelled amplitude mask indeed resembles the desired spectrum, as show in Fig. 3.

The measured spectrum has length n. The ANN accepts a 1D vector, consisting of the measured spectrum concatenated with the desired spectrum, 
with length 2n. The ANN outputs a 1D vector, corresponding to the amplitude mask, of length n.
